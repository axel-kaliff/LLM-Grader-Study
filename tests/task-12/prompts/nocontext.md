Design a linear time O(n) algorithm to reverse a collection and implement two versions in Java, the first with arrays and the second with lists.

Your implementation should count the number of basic operations to ensure that the complexity is O(n) for a given collection of size n. Please implement the two methods in the code skeleton in src/Reverse.java (and don't forget to remove the exceptions that are currently thrown!).
